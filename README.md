# TO-DO-LIST

Hi everyone, my name is Sylvester. The project you are on is my little TO-DO list.
This project was written over a short period and it is written with pure CSS3, HTML5, and JAVASCRIPT.

1. I have a delete button that deletes the exact field you want if you have entered it by mistake.

2. It also comes with a time stamp as to when events were added, to the to-do list.

3. There is a Complete checkbox that when checked crosses out the exact field and deletes after some seconds, I purposely made this delete after some seconds, in case you change your mind and wish to restore it.

4. There is also a “DELETE ALL” button that does as the name implies, it deletes every event entered in the to-do list.

5. The maximum number of events that can be added to the to-do list is 15 events, when this is maxed out you can't add events, however, you can delete events and add more, I can also decide in the future to increase the number of events to be added it is a matter of personal discretion.

6. The input field has a max input of 500 characters.

7. The input field won't accept your entry if there are 5 blank spaces following one another, however, if you're typing and between words, you leave more than one blank space it will shorten it to just 1 blank space upon entry.

8. More Features will be added soon in the future and updated, Thank you.
